# Feed Binding

* Required configuration:

    * **URL** - the URL of the feed (e.g http://example.com/path/file). The binding uses this URL to download data.
    
* Optional configuration:

    * **refresh** - a refresh interval defines after how many minutes the binding will check, if new content is available. Default value is 20 minutes.
